    "summary": "Implementer and leader of teams in charge of delivering distributed app systems that connect user value with business outcomes.  Veteran of distributed teams in organizations with global functionality and impact requiring uncompromising high availability and optimization.  At global scale, companies require finely tuned caching strategy and scalable, resilient, observeable architectures fabricated from interchangeable components (Kubernetes, lambda, serverless architecture or autoscaled ec2 components all fit the bill). The data volume also requires a deep understanding of decoupling and event architecture, and practical experience with message queues and event streaming platforms such as Confluent's Kafka or Confluent Cloud.  Cloud native architecture built from ec2 or managed services is always my first choice.  Fast learner of all languages with a particular lova affair for functional languages and high productivity, high performance tech stacks such as python/pandas/dask/sympy, clojure/ring/spectre, or Rust.  Certified and professionally versed Data Scientist, finding practical ways to operationalize business knowledge with machine learning and deep learning models, with my particular history schewed toward word embedding and NLP based feature prediction.  Has helped form agile teams and establish agile sprint ceremonies.  Looking for companies that understand the value of feature ownership and cultivated internal learning and growth.",
